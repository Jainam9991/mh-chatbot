This is a project in regards to the IBM SkillsBuild Internship with partnership with Edunet Foundation where we were required to make and run a AI/ML project that would track the mental health of the Agent and give necessary feedback in regards to the same.

You can fork or clone the project to try and provide further updates which might make the project more interactive and also provide your own inputs that can make the explaination of the project easy to explain and understand.
